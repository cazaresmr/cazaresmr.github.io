    <h1>Polynomial Graphs - End Behavior</h1>
    
    <blockquote cite="https://mathbitsnotebook.com/Algebra2/Polynomials/POGraphing.html">
        <strong>Behavior:</strong> Looking at a few aspects of a polynomial will tell us what is happening at either end
        of the graph of the polynomial function. We will be looking at the DEGREE of the polynomial and the SIGN of the
        leading coefficient to determine what is happening to the graph. <strong>Definition:</strong> End behavior refers
        to the appearance of a graph as it is followed indefinitely in either horizontal direction.</blockquote>
