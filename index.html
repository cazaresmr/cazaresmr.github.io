		<h2>Teaching Philosopy</h2>
			<p>
				"I believe that there are five essential elements that are conducive to learning. (1) The teacher's role is to act as a guide. (2) Students must have access to hands-on activities. (3) Students should be able to have choices and let their curiosity direct their learning. (4) Students need the opportunity to practice skills in a safe environment. (5) Technology must be incorporated into the school day."

		<h3>What is Mastery Learning?</h3>
		<p>By: Scott Ellis</p>
		<p>Mastery learning is THE transformational education innovation of our time. At its core, mastery learning enables students to move forward at their own pace as they master knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Effective implementation at scale will completely change how students learn, how teachers teach, and how schools work. It will revolutionize state testing, education research, and the labor market. It will transform how curricula are developed, how learning is measured, and how teachers are trained.	<a href="https://www.gettingsmart.com/2019/08/what-is-mastery-learning/" target="_blank">Click this link to read more</a>

		<p>Once in a Lifetime Opportunity to Disrupt the Traditional Classroom Model of Teaching and Learning. In response to the COVID-19 global pandemic, schools are preparing to reopen using a hybrid learning model, where students split their instructional time between home and school. This moment, while challenging, affords educators with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make systemic and pedagogic changes that would otherwise have taken years to implement.	<a href="https://www.corelearningexchange.com/personalized-mastery-based-learning-if-not-now-when/" target="_blank">Click this link to read more</a>

		<h3>Why Mathematics Is a Language</h3>
		<p>By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D.</p>
		<p>Mathematics is called the language of science. Italian astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei is attributed with the quote, "Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe." Most likely this quote is a summary of his statement in Opere Il Saggiatore: <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/why-mathematics-is-a-language-4158142" target="_blank">Click this link to read more</a>
